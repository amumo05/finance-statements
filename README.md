Financial Statement Analysis of Major Companies

This project performs a data analysis of the financial statements of major companies using Python. It combines programming concepts with data visualization to explore company performance.

Features

Programming & Libraries: Uses Python and libraries such as matplotlib for plotting and visualizing data.

Data Structures: Employs built-in data types like Lists, Optional, Interval, and Compound to organize and process financial data efficiently.

Analysis Workflow: The program is organized around a main function that performs the analysis and generates plots for a selected company.

Efficient Execution: A smaller subset of the dataset is used during execution for efficiency, while the full dataset is included to illustrate the structure and format of the data.

Purpose

This project provides a hands-on approach to understanding company financials, combining coding skills with data analysis techniques. It demonstrates how structured data and visualization can reveal insights into company performance trends.
